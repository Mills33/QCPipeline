#!/usr/bin/env Rscript

####
# Script that takes parsed output from BUSCO (full_table.tsv) and produces a bar plot of
# how many times each protein detected. It is important to know the ploidy
# for this to be an effective analysis otherwise slightly redundant - need to know
# if things are meant to occur 2x or 4x etc or if it is an artefact of sequencing.
# Also need to bear in mind whether haploid assembly in which case anything that occurs
# more than 1x is sequencing artefact or possibly real duplication.
#
# The following line must be run on the command line to get the data in the correct format:
# cat full_table.tsv | cut -f 1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | grep -v '#' > busco_results.tsv
